This weather dashboard provides both the current conditions and the 5-day forecast of any city that the user enters in the search box. Information for the current day includes the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a color-coded UV index. The 5-day forecast includes the date, high temperature, and humidity.

Cities searched list on the left side of the page and are stored in local storage until manually wiped, so that a traveller can look at the cities recently searched.

This weather dashboard was built utilizing the BootStrap CSS Framework.
